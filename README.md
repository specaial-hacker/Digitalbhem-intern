*Context*
Creating an HTML calculator involves integrating HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. It typically includes an input display for showing numbers and results, along with buttons for digits, operators, and functions like clear or backspace.

It looks like a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's a breakdown of its components:
- HTML Structure: Defines the basic layout of the calculator using <div> and <input> elements.
- CSS Styling: Styles the calculator elements including background colors, button sizes, and border styles.
- JavaScript Functions:
  - Solve(val): Appends the clicked button's value to the calculator display (res input).
  - Result(): Evaluates the expression entered in the calculator display and displays the result.
  - Clear(): Clears the calculator display.
  - Back(): Deletes the last character from the calculator display.

Functional: Highlights its practicality and utility for calculations.
